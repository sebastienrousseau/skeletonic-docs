## Getting Started

[The Skeletonic Stylus Library](https://skeletonicstylus.com) is a collection of components, functions, and mixins made with [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/). The components and mixins can be used on their own to build modern web sites and applications, but they are also designed to be used in combination with a wide variety of existing technologies.
