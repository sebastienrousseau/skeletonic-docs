# Animations

Skeletonic CSS library provides ready-to-use, cross-browser transitions, transformations, and animations utilities.

## Installation and usage

You will need to import **skeletonic-animations.css** to display the transitions and animations.

The CSS animations are based/inspired by [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) (Another thing from [Daniel Eden](https://daneden.me)).

## Animation styles

Skeletonic CSS allow you to easily create flexible UI transitions and animations.

Here's the list of all the CSS Animations and Transitions:
