## Overview

Text buttons can be placed in front of a variety of backgrounds. Until the button is interacted with, its container isn’t visible.

## Text button states

Skeletonic CSS has multiple buttons states. The button classes can be used on an &lt;a&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, or &lt;input&gt; element.

Based on the action triggered, different types of buttons are available.

## Active State

The active state denotes that a button or setting is interactive.

## Disabled State

The disabled state communicates when a component or element isn’t interactive.

To disable a button, add the disabled attribute directly to the &lt;button&gt;, or set the disabled attribute on the &lt;fieldset&gt; containing the button. Disabled buttons cannot be interacted with and have no visual interaction effect.

## Focused State

The focused state communicates when a user has highlighted an element using a keyboard or voice.

## Hovered State

The hovered state communicates when a user has placed a cursor above an interactive element.

## Pressed State

The pressed state communicates a user click, tap, or press.
