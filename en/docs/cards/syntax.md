# Basic syntax

In order to create a basic card, you will need to:

-  Use .card with a div tag to create the outer container
-  Add the .card-content class to an inner div tag to create the card content

These are the basic elements that constitute a basic card layout, as we can see from the following example:

```sh
<div class=" flex-12">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-content">
<h4>Title</h4> 
<p>Lorem ipsum.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
