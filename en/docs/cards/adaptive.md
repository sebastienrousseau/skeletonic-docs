# Adaptive card

An adaptive card is a customizable card that can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields.

 Cards can have multiple properties and attachments. Cards can include buttons which can trigger Card actions.

 Cards support formatting in the text property only, not in the title or subtitle properties. Formatting can be specified using a subset of XML (HTML) formatting, or Markdown depending on card type. For current and future development Adaptive cards using Markdown formatting is recommended.
Formatting support differs between different card types, and rendering of the card can differ slightly between the desktop and the mobile Teams clients, as well as Teams in the desktop browser.
